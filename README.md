# About
This is a collection of scripts that I've created for Reaper. They are mainly focused around my game audio workflow designing individual assets. 

**SWS and the js_ReaScriptAPI extensions are both required to be installed for most scripts to work correctly.**

Many scripts include more specific information on their functionality in their header and some also include user configurable settings near the top of the file.

# Installation:
You can install these scripts by using ReaPack. From inside Reaper go to the menu: _Extension > ReaPack > Import Repositories..._ and copy and past the link below into the dialogue box.
